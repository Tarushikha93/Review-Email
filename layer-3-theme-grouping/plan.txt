# Layer 3: Theme Grouping Plan

## Objective
Group similar customer feedback segments into meaningful themes to identify common patterns and insights.

## Input
- Segmented reviews from Layer 2 (segment_themes.parquet)
- Raw review text and metadata

## Process
1. Load segmented data from Layer 2
2. Apply clustering/grouping algorithm to identify similar segments
3. Generate theme labels and descriptions
4. Calculate theme statistics (segment count, average rating, etc.)
5. Output structured theme data

## Output
- themes.json: Structured theme definitions
- segment_themes.parquet: Updated segments with theme assignments
- theme_summary.csv: High-level theme statistics

## Dependencies
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- pyarrow
- numpy

## Next Steps
- Pass themes to Layer 4 for insight generation
- Review and validate theme quality
- Adjust clustering parameters as needed
