Worst app. It claims to be able to track all ur investments on various platforms & also bank accounts. I wasted a lot of time getting all of the accounts linked. The transactions are not updated even after days while one of the accounts got delinked twice, all by itself. Not sure how. I tried linking it again, but with no luck. Buying SIPs is another hassle on this app. The mandate just doesn't get uploaded & I have had to reach out to customer service every single time to get this sorted.
