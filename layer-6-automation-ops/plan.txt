Layer Goal: Automate weekly workflow with governance.

Key Steps:
1. Orchestration: Use cron/Airflow to chain layers with retries; pass artifacts via shared storage (e.g., S3 bucket or local volume).
2. Observability: Emit metrics for review volume, theme counts, model cost, and email send status to person
3. Versioning: Store prompts, model versions, and weekly outputs in git for traceability.
4. Security & Compliance: Document that only public data is used; mask any accidental PII before persistence.
5. Cost Control: Cache embeddings, batch API calls, and fail fast when upstream data volume is too low.
6. Stakeholder Loop: Send confirmation to product/ops once email is ready, capturing feedback for next iteration.
